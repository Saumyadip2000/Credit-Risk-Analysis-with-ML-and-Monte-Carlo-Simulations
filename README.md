# Credit Risk Analysis and Monte Carlo Simulation

## Overview
This project is a **Streamlit** web application for credit risk analysis and scoring and downloading results. It includes:
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Machine learning models (Random Forest and XGBoost) for credit risk predictions
- FICO credit scoring
- Threshold-based credit decision-making
- Monte Carlo simulations for income projections
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Features
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Users can upload their datasets, train models, and visualize results.
- **Credit Scoring**: FICO scores generated from predicted probabilities.
- **Threshold-Based Decision Making**: Allows dynamic adjustment of thresholds for loan approval.
- **Monte Carlo and GBM Simulations**: Visualizes income predictions using simulations.
- **EDA**: Correlation matrix and distribution plots for insights.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Backend**: Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost)
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn
- **Deployment**: Streamlit
